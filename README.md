This is a simple (cute) calculator. Here is a list of it's current features:
- Basic operations: +, -, *, /
- Unary operations:
    - %: Converts number to decimal value out of 100
    - +/-: Negates the current number's sign
- Point operations: Adds a decimal point to a currently entered number, will not add a decimal if there is one already
- Clear functions:
    -AC: Clears all stored data, such as both operands and the current operator
    -CE: Removes the latest entered character from the display

Here are some features I'd like to add in the future:
- A history section where users can see previous calculations
- The ability to enter numbers using the keyboard
- A section that tells the user the functionality of the button they're hovering over.
